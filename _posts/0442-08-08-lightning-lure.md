You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you and then take 1d8 lightning damage if it is within 5 feet of you.

This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
