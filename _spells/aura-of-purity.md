Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) canâ€™t become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against affects that cause any of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned and stunned.
