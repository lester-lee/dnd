Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
