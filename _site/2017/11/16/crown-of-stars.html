<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</p>

<p>Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.</p>

<p>If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of motes created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.</p>
