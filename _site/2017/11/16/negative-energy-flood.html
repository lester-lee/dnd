<p><strong>5th-level necromancy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, M (a broken bone and a square of black silk)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p>

<p>You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the zombie are in the <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p>

<p>If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesnâ€™t make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.</p>
