<p><strong>8th-level evocation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, M (a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to ﬁll a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can’t illuminate the area.</p>

<p>Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
