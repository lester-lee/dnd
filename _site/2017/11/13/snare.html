<p><strong>1st-level abjuration</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 8 hours</p>

<p>As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magical trap.</p>

<p>The trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.</p>

<p>The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spellâ€™s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.</p>

<p>A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.</p>

<p>After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.</p>
