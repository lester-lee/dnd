<p><strong>1st-level conjuration</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 bonus action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Self</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.</p>

<p>While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch a creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
