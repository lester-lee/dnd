The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it’s invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can’t become invisible until the spell ends.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
