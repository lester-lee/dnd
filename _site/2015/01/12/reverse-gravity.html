<p><strong>7th-level transmutation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 100 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that arenâ€™t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.</p>

<p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creature strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p>

<p>At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>
