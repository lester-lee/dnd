<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell–called the contingent spell–as part of casting <em>Contingency</em>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a <em>Contingency</em> cast with <em><a href="water-breathing">Water Breathing</a></em> might stipulate that <em>Water Breathing</em> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p>

<p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and then contingency ends.</p>

<p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <em>Contingency</em> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <em>Contingency</em> spell on you ends. Also, <em>Contingency</em> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>
