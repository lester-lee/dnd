<p><strong>5th-level divination (ritual)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Self</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p>You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.</p>

<p>Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.</p>

<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>
