<p><strong>5th-level transmutation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 bonus action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.</p>

<p>On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.</p>
