<p><strong>4th-level transmutation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p>

<p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isnâ€™t possible.</p>
