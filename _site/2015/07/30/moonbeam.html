<p><strong>2nd-level evocation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p>

<p>When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>

<p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spells light.</p>

<p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell use can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
