<p><strong>5th-level evocation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).</p>

<p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by <em><a href="dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a></em>. A <em><a href="disintegrate">Disintegrate</a></em> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>
