<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of sponge)</p>

<p>You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren’t affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p>Nonmagical plants in the area that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.</p>
