<p><strong>4th-level transmutation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 min</p>

<p>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.</p>

<p>Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and moment.</p>

<p>A creature remains in its giant size for the duration until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p>

<p>The DM might allow you to choose different targets. for example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same stats as a giant wasp.</p>
