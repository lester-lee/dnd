<p><strong>2nd-level divination (ritual)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Self</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p>

<p>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 min. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Weal</em>, for good results</li>
  <li><em>Woe</em>, for bad results</li>
  <li><em>Weal and woe</em>, for both good and bad results</li>
  <li><em>Nothing</em>, for results that aren’t especially good or bad</li>
</ul>

<p>The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p>

<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>
