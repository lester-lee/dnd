<p><strong>Transmutation cantrip</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 bonus action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p>You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attackerâ€™s, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.</p>

<p>If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.</p>
