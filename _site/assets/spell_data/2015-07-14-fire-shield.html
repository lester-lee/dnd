<p><strong>4th-level evocation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Self</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorous or a firefly)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 10 min</p>

<p>Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.</p>

<p>The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.</p>

<p>In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.</p>
