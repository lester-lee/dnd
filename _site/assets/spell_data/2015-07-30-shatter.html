<p><strong>2nd-level evocation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a chip of mica)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p>

<p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>

<p>A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
