<p><strong>Transmutation cantrip</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: S</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)</p>

<p>You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.</li>
  <li>You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</li>
  <li>You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>
