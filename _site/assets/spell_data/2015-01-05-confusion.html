<p><strong>4th-level enchantment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (three nut shells)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.</p>

<p>An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>: The creature uses up all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.</p>

<p><strong>2-6</strong>: The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.</p>

<p><strong>7-8</strong>: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.</p>

<p><strong>9-10</strong>: The creature can act and move normally.</p>

<p>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each spell slot above 4th.</p>
