<p><strong>3rd-level evocation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p>

<p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p>The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
