<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 10 min</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 24 hours</p>

<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p>

<p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p>

<p><em>Guards and wards</em> creates the following effects within the warded area.</p>

<p><strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p>

<p><strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <em><a href="arcane-lock/" title="arcane lock (lvl 2)">arcane lock</a></em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <em><a href="minor-illusion" title="minor illusion (cantrip)">minor illusion</a></em> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>

<p><strong>Stairs.</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <em><a href="web" title="web (lvl 2)">web</a></em> spell. These strands regrow in 10 min if they are burned or torn away while guards and wars lasts.</p>

<p><strong>Other Spell Effect.</strong> You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place <em><a href="dancing-lights" title="dancing lights (cantrip)">dancing lights</a></em> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.</li>
  <li>Place <em><a href="magic-mouth" title="magic mouth (lvl 2)">magic mouth</a></em> in two locations.</li>
  <li>Place <em><a href="stinking-cloud" title="stinking cloud (lvl 3)">stinking cloud</a></em> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; They return within 10 min if dispersed by wind while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.</li>
  <li>Place a constant <em><a href="gust-of-wind" title="gust of wind (lvl 2)">gust of wind</a></em> in one corridor or room.</li>
  <li>Place a <em><a href="suggestion" title="suggestion (lvl 2)">suggestion</a></em> in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A <em><a href="dispel-magic" title="dispel magic (lvl 3)">dispel magic</a></em> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p>

<p>You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.</p>
