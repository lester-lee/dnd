<p><strong>Transmutation cantrip</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: S</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)</p>

<p>You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.</li>
  <li>You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>
