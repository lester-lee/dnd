<p>Flames race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the spell’s duration. The flames don’t harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are immune to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage.</li>
  <li>Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.</li>
  <li>You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
</ul>
